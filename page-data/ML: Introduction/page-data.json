In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture</li>\n<li>Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>\n<p><strong>Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.</strong> We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables.</p>\n<p>We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.</p>\n<p>With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.</li>\n<li>Non-clustering: The “Cocktail Party Algorithm”, allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment.
